# ECMAScript Module Integration

As youâ€™ve seen in the previous chapters WebAssembly modules need to be fetched, the imports constructed, and the module instantiated, as shown below:

```javascript
let req = fetch("./myModule.wasm");

let imports = {
  aModule: {
    anImport,
  },
};

WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(req, imports).then((obj) =>
  obj.instance.exports.foo()
);
```

The goal of this specification is to allow modules to be loaded directly by import statements:

```javascript
import { foo } from "./myModule.wasm";
foo();
```

This proposal also seeks to make it possible to load WebAssembly modules directly via script tags, using the module type:

```javascript
<script type="module" src="./myModule.wasm"></script>
```

Various JavaScript module bundlers (Rollup, Webpack) are already implementing similar behaviors, allowing developers to bundle (i.e. combine) JavaScript and WebAssembly into a single file for download. This proposal seeks to standardize this process.
